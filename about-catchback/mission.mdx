Our mission is to create a liquid, transparent, and fair ecosystem where passion meets smart investing to combat problems plaguing investors and collectors
for decades.

## Fundamental Problems in the Collectibles Market

| **Problem** | **CatchBack Solution** |
|-------------|------------------------|
| **Marketplace Fees** <br/>eBay charges 13-15% fees, destroying profit margins on high-value cards | **Zero Add-On Fees** <br/>Complete elimination of listing, final value, and overbearing fees |
| **Liquidity Crisis** <br/>No guaranteed way to convert cards to cash at fair prices, unreliable buyers | **Guaranteed Buybacks** <br/>Instant liquidity at competitive market value with CatchCoins conversion |
| **Pack Transparency** <br/>Mystery pack sites hide contents, show only grails, filled with unwanted floors | **Transparent Packs** <br/>Pick your own cards, set odds, complete visibility into all possible outcomes |
| **Idle Collections** <br/>Valuable collections sitting stagnant with no way to generate additional returns | **Card-Backed Loans** <br/>Borrow against cards or earn interest funding other collectors' loans |
| **Storage & Security** <br/>Collectors lack professional storage, insurance, and security for valuable cards | **Professional Vaulting** <br/>Climate-controlled, insured storage with authentication and shipping services |

## Our Founding Story

Like many collectors, we're passionate about chase cards—those rare, high-value gems that make collecting exciting. But we experienced firsthand the frustrations that every collector knows too well.

> *"I pulled a \$2,000 Charizard and spent 3 months trying to sell it. Between eBay fees, flaky buyers, and lowball dealer offers, I barely got \$1,400. This sucks."*
> 
> **— CatchBack Co-Founder**

This moment crystallized everything wrong with the current system. Collectors shouldn't have to choose between keeping their cards forever or losing massive value when they need liquidity.
