We're transforming the collectibles market by solving fundamental problems that have plagued collectors and investors for decades. Our mission is to create a liquid, transparent, and fair ecosystem where passion meets smart investing.

## The Problems We Faced

Like many collectors, we're passionate about chase cards—those rare, high-value gems that make collecting exciting. But we hit the same frustrating walls every collector knows:

- **eBay fees eating 13-15% of every sale**, destroying profit margins, especially on high-value cards
- **Unreliable buyers backing out of deals**
- **Endless searching for reputable resellers and dealers**
- **Price volatility makes owning cards risky**

We realized the trading card market had a fundamental liquidity problem—no guaranteed way to convert cards to cash at fair prices.

## The Breaking Point

> *"I pulled a \$2,000 Charizard and spent 3 months trying to sell it. Between eBay fees, flaky buyers, and lowball dealer offers, I barely got \$1,400. This sucks."*
> 
> **- CatchBack Co-Founder**

This moment crystallized everything wrong with the current system. Collectors shouldn't have to choose between keeping their cards forever or losing massive value when they need liquidity.

## The CatchBack Buyback Solution

We built a system that fundamentally changes how collectors think about their investments:

## How We're Changing the Game

**What if every chase card came with guaranteed liquidity?** No more hunting for buyers, no more fee anxiety, no more risking scams.

We built relationships with major dealers, developed real-time pricing algorithms, and created an ecosystem for all collectors.

Today, when you buy a graded slab or sealed product from us, you know exactly what it's worth and can convert it to cash anytime. We've eliminated the liquidity problem that held back collectors for decades.

**Collecting chase cards is now a smart investment. Your passion becomes your portfolio.**

## The Mystery Pack Scam Problem

The trading card market has been flooded with unregulated "mystery packs" from social media influencers and unverified sellers. These packs prey on collectors' excitement while providing no transparency or accountability.

### The Current Problems
- **Streamers and Instagram "mystery packs"** flooding the market with zero transparency
- **Rigged odds that can't be verified or audited**
- **Worthless inventory dumps** disguised as premium mystery boxes
- **No way to verify** if contents are real or if you're being scammed

## Provably Fair Randomness

We built a truly provably fair system where every algorithm, every probability, and every transaction can be independently verified.
