# Shipping at CatchBack

We make shipping your collectibles simple, safe, and affordable with professional logistics and full insurance coverage.

## Q1 2026 Promotional Period

**Free Shipping on Slabs**

We're currently offering free shipping on all slabs as part of our promotional period during Q1 2026. This allows you to get your valuable graded cards shipped at no cost to you.

**Starter Packs (Booster Packs) Shipping**

Since starter packs are offered as promotional items, we do charge shipping for standalone starter pack orders. However, if you include starter packs with your graded slab orders, they ship for free alongside your slabs—no additional shipping charges.
