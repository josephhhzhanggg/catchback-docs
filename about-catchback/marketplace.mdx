The CatchBack Marketplace revolutionizes collectibles trading with transparent, minimal fees - just $1 per party to cover gas and technology costs at the time of sale while protecting market integrity.

## $1 Per Party Fee Structure

- **$0 Listing Fees**: List unlimited items at no cost
- **$0 Commission**: No percentage-based fees on sales
- **$1 Buyer Fee**: Covers gas fees and technology costs for buyers
- **$1 Seller Fee**: Covers gas fees and technology costs for sellers

## Why $1 Each Matters

Traditional marketplaces like eBay charge 13-15% in combined fees, destroying profit margins especially on high-value cards. CatchBack charges just \$2 total (\$1 each), allowing traders to keep virtually 99% of their sale value.

## Anti-Manipulation Protection

The \$1 fee from each party serves a dual purpose: covering necessary technology costs while discouraging botting and artificial price inflation that harms genuine collectors. This small friction cost prevents automated manipulation while remaining negligible for real transactions.

## Trade with Confidence

Every transaction is backed by our digital-physical card mapping system, ensuring authenticity and providing guaranteed liquidity through our buyback program.
