The CatchBack Marketplace revolutionizes collectibles trading with transparent, minimal fees - just $1 per party to cover gas and technology costs at the time of sale while protecting market integrity.

## The eBay Fee Problem

We were very frustrated with how eBay's large fees would eat into the cost of transactions for collectibles. Traditional marketplaces like eBay charge multiple layers of fees that can add up to 13-15% of your sale price:

### Problem 1: Listing Fees
**The Issue:** eBay usually allows a limited number of free listings per month. After that, they charge a fee just for putting an item up for sale. This ensures casual sellers get some flexibility but also generates revenue from high-volume sellers.

**CatchBack's Solution:** We offer $0 listing fees with unlimited listings, removing the barrier to entry for all sellers regardless of volume.

### Problem 2: Final Value Fees
**The Issue:** eBay takes a percentage of the final sale price, including shipping in many cases. Typically 10–15%, but can go higher for certain categories (like collectibles, fashion, or electronics). This is eBay's primary revenue source, so it's built into their business model.

**CatchBack's Solution:** We charge a flat \$1 fee per party instead of percentage-based fees, so a \$500 card costs just \$2 total in fees instead of \$60+.

### Problem 3: Optional Add-Ons
**The Issue:** Sellers can pay for upgrades like bold titles, extra photos, listing in multiple categories, or promoted listings (boost visibility) — these are extra fees on top of the final value.

**CatchBack's Solution:** Our platform uses algorithms to boost listings that are more competitive in price to the front pages of the screen. This makes it fair to everyone and introduces liquidity into the system - no need to pay for promotions or upgrades to get your items seen.

### Problem 4: High-Value Collectibles Penalty
**The Issue:** Collectors' items are often high-value, so the percentage fee translates to significant dollars. For example, a \$500 card with a 12% final value fee = \$60. Add shipping and listing upgrades, and it adds up fast.

**CatchBack's Solution:** Our flat fee structure means high-value items aren't penalized. Whether you're selling a \$50 card or a \$5,000 card, you pay the same \$1 fee.

## Our Solution: Digital-Physical Bridge

We create a system where we reduce those fees by acting as the middleman who holds the physical card, so that the ownership of the card can transact with less friction through a digital representation. This allows us to be more efficient with:

- **Chargeback fees** - Reduced dispute costs through our digital system
- **Payment processing** - Streamlined transactions without traditional marketplace overhead
- **Dispute resolution** - Faster, more efficient conflict resolution
- **Shipping streamlining** - No need to ship cards for each transaction

We can pass those efficiency wins to our ecosystem participants.
