### Pack Building Process

#### Step 1: Select Your Cards
Choose the specific cards you want to appear in your pack from our authenticated database.

#### Step 2: Set Your Odds, Risk Level, and Pack Price
Pick from random levels to different risk levels using our drag and drop interface. The price adjusts automatically as you modify the odds, and
you can modify the price by varying the pull probabilities with cards. 

#### Step 3: Open Your Pack
Once you're satisfied with your card selection and odds, open your pack and see what you get! 


#### Step 4: Choose What to Do with Your Cards
After opening your pack, you have complete flexibility with your cards:

## What Makes Our Packs Transparent?

### Complete Odds Disclosure
Unlike traditional packs where odds are hidden or vague, every pack you buy or build and buy shows:
- **Exact pull rates** for every possible card or item
- **Real-time optimization system** that ensures fair pack pricing

### Verifiable Randomness

  <Tab title="Audit Trail">
    Every pack opening is recorded with a complete audit trail showing the random seed, algorithm used, and final result.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Public Verification">
    Anyone can verify the randomness and fairness of any pack opening using our open-source verification tools.
  </Tab>

### Real-Time Optimization System

Our real-time optimization system continuously monitors live market values and automatically sorts cards into value buckets (P0-P5). A \$45 card in the P1 bucket (\$40-50) moves to P2 (\$50-100) if its price increases, ensuring probability tables always reflect current market reality.

The system uses **[machine learning optimization](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html)** to minimize the difference between expected value and pack price. It heavily penalizes scenarios where expected value is less than price, then iteratively adjusts probabilities until optimal.

Result: Pack probabilities automatically adapt to market conditions while guaranteeing you never pay more than expected value. For technical implementation details, see our [Provably Fair](/about-catchback/provably-fair) page.
