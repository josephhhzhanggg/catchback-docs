# Create Custom Packs

## Transparent Packs • Open Source

**Create your own custom packs. Pick cards, odds, and risk level with complete transparency for pulls.**

Transparent Packs revolutionize the traditional pack-opening experience by giving you full visibility into contents, odds, and expected values before you make any purchase decision.

## What Makes Our Packs Transparent?

### Complete Odds Disclosure
Unlike traditional packs where odds are hidden or vague, every Transparent Pack shows:
- **Exact pull rates** for every card or item
- **Expected value calculations** based on current market prices
- **Detailed breakdowns** of potential outcomes
- **Risk/reward analysis** for each pack type

### Open Source Methodology
Our pack creation process is completely transparent:
- **Public algorithms** for pack generation and odds calculation
- **Verifiable randomness** using blockchain-based random number generation
- **Auditable results** with full transaction history
- **Community validation** of pack contents and odds

  rares: 0.04 * $100.00,        // 4% chance × $100 value
  chases: 0.01 * $1000.00,      // 1% chance × $1000 value
  
  totalEV: $3.75 + $3.00 + $4.00 + $10.00 // = $20.75
};
