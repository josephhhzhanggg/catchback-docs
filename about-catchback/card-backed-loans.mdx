CatchBack's card-backed lending protocol creates a new financial ecosystem where your collection becomes productive capital. Whether you need liquidity without selling your cards or want to earn yield on idle capital, our platform connects borrowers and lenders in a secure, transparent marketplace.

## How It Works

### For Borrowers

3. **Access Funds**: Borrow up to 70% of your cards' current market value
4. **Retain Ownership**: Keep full ownership rights to your collateral

### For Lenders
Earn competitive interest rates by funding loans backed by authenticated collectibles.

**Investment Process:**
1. **Browse Opportunities**: Review available loan requests with collateral details
2. **Assess Risk**: Evaluate borrower profiles and collateral quality
