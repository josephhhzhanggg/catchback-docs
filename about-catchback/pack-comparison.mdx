## <u>Problems No One Should Deal With</u>

Large commercial sites and streamers flood their packs with undesirable items that collectors never wanted in the first place. These platforms show you the grails in their marketing but don't reveal that most of their floor hits are things you would have never wanted in the first place.

### Problem 1: Misleading Expectations
**The Issue:** Pack sites show you the grails in their marketing but hide disappointing outcomes. You only have limited possible upside - only 1% or less of the time will you hit the very expensive grail card.

**CatchBack's Solution:** Our site lets you pick the exact odds of hitting that card in your custom pack. Complete transparency means you see all possible outcomes before you buy.

### Problem 2: Average Pack Pull Being Less than Pack Cost
**The Issue:** Many other sites make money by charging you above the average cost of a hit for ripping open a pack.

**CatchBack's Solution:** CatchBack packs have equal average hit value equal to your pack price. For example, when you open a \$50 Silver pack, your average hit will be equal to \$50.

### Problem 3: Boring Pack Compositions
**The Issue:** Other pack opening sites are boring. They fill their packs with floors that absolutely no one wants, and they don't show what you could possibly hit (often just showing the grails).

**CatchBack's Solution:** We want people to pick their own risk levels. You have complete control over your experience, from cards going into your mystery packs to the risk level to the prices you pay for the packs.

### Problem 4: Questionable Fairness
**The Issue:** Most pack sites use questionable randomness systems that can't be independently verified.

**CatchBack's Solution:** Our pack opening system uses cryptographically secure randomness that you can verify. Every card pull is truly random and fair, with complete transparency in our algorithms.
