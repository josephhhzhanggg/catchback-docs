# Differentiating Ourselves from Other Pack Sites

## <u>Problems No One Should Deal With</u>

Large commercial sites and streamers flood their packs with undesirable items that collectors never wanted in the first place. These platforms show you the grails in their marketing but don't reveal that most of their floor hits are things you would have never wanted in the first place.

### Misleading Expectations
Pack sites show you the grails in their marketing but hide disappointing outcomes. You only have limited possible upside - only 1% or less of the time will you hit the very expensive grail card. Our site lets you pick the exact odds of hitting that card in your custom pack.

### Average Pack Pull Being Less than Pack Cost
Many other sites make money by charging you above the average cost of a hit for ripping open a pack. CatchBack packs have equal average 
hit value equal to your price pack. For example, when you open a 50 dollar Silver pack, your average hit will be equal to 50 dollars. 

### Boring Pack Compositions
Other pack opening sites are boring. They fill their packs with floors that absolutely no one wants, and they don't show what you could possibly hit (often just showing the grails). We want people to pick their own risk levels.

## The CatchBack Solution

### Maximal Excitement
We give users complete control over their experience, from cards going into their mystery packs to the risk level to the prices they pay for the packs.

### Provably Fair Technology
Our pack opening system uses cryptographically secure randomness that you can verify. Every card pull is truly random and fair, with complete transparency in our algorithms.
