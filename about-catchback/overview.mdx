## The CatchBack Difference

### Liquidity Revolution
Traditional collectibles are illiquid assets that can take weeks or months to sell. CatchBack transforms your cards into liquid investments with guaranteed buyback options.

### Transparency First
Unlike traditional pack openings where odds are hidden, our transparent pack system lets you see exactly what you're getting into.

### Professional Infrastructure
From climate-controlled vaulting to \$1 marketplace listings, we provide institutional-grade services to individual collectors.
