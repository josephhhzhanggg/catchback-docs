We're revolutionizing the auction experience with Dutch style auctions that solve the problems of traditional auction platforms like eBay.

## The eBay Auction Problem

An issue we saw with eBay was that people would need to wait several hours or days before securing a purchase, and their notification system was very slow. This created frustration and missed opportunities for both buyers and sellers.

## Our Solution: Gamified Dutch Auctions

We're gamifying the experience to make purchasing cards fun. Our Dutch style auctions create excitement and urgency while providing real-time updates and instant notifications.
