# Provably Fair

## Cryptographically Secure â€¢ Independently Verifiable

**Every pack opening uses provably fair technology that you can verify yourself.**

CatchBack's provably fair system ensures that every pack opening is truly random and cannot be manipulated. Our cryptographic approach gives you mathematical proof that your pack results are fair and unbiased.

## How Provably Fair Works

### Cryptographic Randomness
Our system uses blockchain-based random number generation combined with cryptographic hashing to ensure true randomness that can be independently verified.

### Three-Step Verification Process

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card
    title="1. Client Seed"
    icon="user"
  >
    You provide a random string (client seed) that influences the outcome
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="2. Server Seed"
    icon="server"
  >
    We generate a server seed and provide you with its hash before the pack opens
  </Card>
  
  <Card
    title="3. Verification"
    icon="check-circle"
  >
    After opening, you can verify the results using both seeds and our open-source algorithm
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Complete Transparency

### Open Source Algorithm
Our pack opening algorithm is completely open source, allowing anyone to:
- Review the randomness generation code
- Verify that no manipulation is possible
- Reproduce pack results using the same seeds
- Audit the fairness of any pack opening

### Real-Time Verification
Every pack opening provides:
- **Pre-reveal Hash**: Server seed hash shown before opening
- **Complete Seeds**: Both client and server seeds revealed after opening
- **Verification Tools**: Built-in tools to verify your pack results
- **Audit Trail**: Permanent record of all randomness inputs and outputs

## Mathematical Proof of Fairness

### Cryptographic Hashing
We use SHA-256 cryptographic hashing to ensure that:
- Server seeds cannot be manipulated after being committed
- Pack results are mathematically determined by the seeds
- No external interference can affect the randomness
- All results can be independently verified

### Blockchain Integration
Our randomness incorporates blockchain data to provide:
- **Immutable Timestamps**: Permanent record of when packs were opened
- **Decentralized Verification**: Anyone can verify results using blockchain data
- **Tamper-Proof Records**: Impossible to alter pack opening history
- **Public Auditability**: Complete transparency in our randomness sources

## Verification Tools

### Built-in Verifier
Our platform includes a built-in verification tool that lets you:
- Input your client seed and our server seed
- Run the same algorithm that determined your pack results
- Confirm that your actual results match the mathematical outcome
- Verify that no manipulation occurred

### External Verification
You can also verify pack results using:
- Third-party verification tools
- Your own implementation of our open-source algorithm
- Independent auditing services
- Community verification tools

## Trust Through Transparency

### No Trust Required
Unlike traditional pack openings where you must trust the operator, our provably fair system requires no trust:
- **Mathematical Proof**: Cryptographic verification replaces trust
- **Open Source**: All code is publicly auditable
- **Independent Verification**: Verify results without relying on us
- **Community Oversight**: Public algorithm allows community auditing

### Industry-Leading Standards
Our provably fair implementation follows industry best practices:
- **Cryptographic Security**: Military-grade randomness generation
- **Open Source Standards**: Publicly auditable algorithms
- **Blockchain Integration**: Decentralized verification methods
- **Academic Review**: Algorithm reviewed by cryptography experts

## Getting Started with Verification

### For Every Pack Opening
1. **Set Your Client Seed**: Choose your own random string before opening
2. **Note the Server Hash**: We show you the server seed hash before revealing results
3. **Open Your Pack**: Experience the excitement of your customized pack
4. **Verify Results**: Use our tools to mathematically confirm fairness
