# Intellectual Property Rights

**Last Updated**: January 2026

## Overview

CatchBack operates a marketplace for trading physical collectible cards, including trading cards featuring characters and imagery from third-party intellectual property holders such as The Pokémon Company, sports leagues, and other content owners. This page explains our position on intellectual property rights and how we comply with applicable laws.

## Our Business Model

CatchBack provides a platform for users to buy, sell, trade, and store physical collectible cards that they own. We facilitate transactions involving authentic, legally manufactured trading cards.

### What We Do

- **Sell physical cards we own**: We list and sell physical trading cards that CatchBack legally owns
- **Facilitate user transactions**: We provide a marketplace where users can buy and sell cards they own
- **Display product images**: We display images of trading cards for identification and sale purposes

### What We Do Not Do

- **We do not reproduce copyrighted material**: We do not create or distribute unauthorized reproductions of trading card artwork, characters, or designs
- **We do not claim ownership of third-party IP**: We do not claim ownership of Pokémon, sports team names, or any other third-party intellectual property
- **We do not manufacture cards**: We do not produce or manufacture trading cards; we only deal in authentic, legally produced cards

## Legal Framework: First Sale Doctrine

Our business operates under the **first sale doctrine**, a legal principle that allows the owner of a lawfully made copy of a copyrighted work to sell, display, or otherwise dispose of that copy without the copyright owner's permission.

### Key Points:

1. **Physical Ownership**: When you purchase a physical trading card, you own that physical item
2. **Right to Resell**: You have the right to resell, trade, or display cards you own without authorization from the IP owner
3. **Limited Use**: This right extends to the physical item itself, not to reproducing copyrighted material

## Product Images and Listings

### Use of Product Images

We display images of trading cards in our marketplace listings for the following legitimate purposes:

- **Product Identification**: To enable buyers to identify and verify the specific card being sold
- **Condition Assessment**: To show the condition and authenticity of the card
- **Sale Facilitation**: To provide necessary product information for legitimate resale transactions

### Fair Use and Nominative Fair Use

Our use of trading card images and product names falls under fair use and nominative fair use principles:

- **Nominative Fair Use**: We use product names (e.g., "Pokémon," "Charizard") to identify the products we're selling, which is protected use
- **Product Information**: We display product images and information necessary for identifying and selling the physical cards
- **No Confusion**: Our use does not suggest endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation with IP owners
- **Legitimate Commerce**: Our use serves a legitimate commercial purpose in facilitating sales of lawfully obtained physical goods

## Third-Party Intellectual Property

### Our Respect for IP Rights

CatchBack respects the intellectual property rights of all content owners. We recognize that:

- **Pokémon** and related characters, names, and designs are trademarks and copyrights of The Pokémon Company and Nintendo
- **Sports team names, logos, and player images** are owned by respective leagues, teams, and players
- **Other trading card properties** are owned by their respective rights holders

### Our Compliance

We comply with intellectual property laws by:

1. **Only dealing in authentic products**: We only facilitate transactions involving authentic, legally manufactured trading cards
2. **Not reproducing copyrighted material**: We do not create unauthorized reproductions, copies, or derivatives
3. **Proper use of product images**: We use product images solely for identification and sale of physical items we own
4. **Clear disclaimers**: We do not claim ownership of or affiliation with third-party intellectual property

## User Responsibilities

When using our platform, you agree to:

- **Sell only authentic cards**: List only genuine, legally obtained trading cards
- **Respect IP rights**: Do not reproduce, copy, or create derivative works from trading card artwork
- **No false claims**: Do not claim ownership of or unauthorized affiliation with third-party IP
